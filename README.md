Understanding the relationship between selling price, customer acquisition cost (CAC), and taxes is crucial for maximizing profitability. In this analysis, I explored how changes in key business variables affect financial performance.

🔹 Key Insights:
✅ Increasing Selling Price from $30 to $35 → Raises break-even CAC from $8.20 to $12.45 and boosts profit after tax.
✅ Rising Fixed Costs by $5,000 → Requires selling 7,174 units instead of 5,000 to stay profitable.
✅ Sales Drop from 5,000 to 4,000 Units → Lowers break-even CAC and reduces profit after tax by 36%.
✅ Tax Rate Increase from 20% to 25% → Reduces profit after tax by 6.25% ($575 loss).

📈 Strategic Takeaways:

Adjusting pricing strategy can increase CAC flexibility.

Controlling fixed & variable costs is essential for sustainable growth.

Understanding tax implications helps in better financial planning.

𝐂𝐑𝐌 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
I've developed a CRM system that helps businesses analyze the impact of pricing, customer acquisition cost (CAC), and taxes on profitability. By dynamically adjusting key business variables, users can make data-driven decisions to maximize their profits.

🔹 Key Features & Insights from the CRM:
✅ Pricing Optimization: Increasing the selling price from $30 to $35 raised the break-even CAC from $8.20 to $12.45, improving profit margins.
✅ Cost Management: A $5,000 increase in fixed costs required a higher sales volume (7,174 units instead of 5,000) to maintain profitability.
✅ Sales Volume Analysis: If sales drop from 5,000 to 4,000 units, profitability falls by 36%, showing the importance of demand forecasting.
✅ Tax Impact Simulation: Raising the tax rate from 20% to 25% reduced profit after tax by 6.25%, highlighting the need for strategic tax planning.

📈 Why This Matters:
My CRM system enables businesses to adjust pricing, control costs, and predict profitability outcomes—all in real time. It’s a powerful tool for companies looking to scale efficiently while maintaining healthy margins.
